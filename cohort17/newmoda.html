        write up on clearing process


The movement of goods from one country to another across national borders through air or sea, necessitates the use of a middle man with an in depth and robust knowledge of customs clearance. this individual or middle man is called a clearing agent and forwarding agent. Countries have strict regulatory requirements governing customs these requirements can be complex, most cases it requires local accredited agents to act on behalf of the importer or exporter when interfacing with border agencies and customs authorities.
Carrying out customs clearance requires a lot of planning, these plans helps put things in motion to facilitates fast delivery. The planning starts with pre shipments and post shipment.
Rotation number gives the agent an idea of where the shipment will be discharged and ready for clearing. this also enable the agent or the customer service representative to punch or key in the shipment details, payment and other information to generate the SGD (single goods declaration).
Pre shipment: this start with form m application to the bank alongside other documents like pro forma invoice, local marine insurance, SON certificate/Nafdac depends on the goods. Once this is done and approved, importer is advised about the approve form m, then he can proceed with importation.
In advance documents are received by the importer banks or sent via courier. These documents are Bill of Lading, final invoice, parking list, CCVO. (combine certificate of value and origin). The documents are forwarded to Nigeria customs to check if the information on the documents are imputed correctly after which NcS (Nigeria custom service) can issue a PAAR (Pre Arrival Assessment Report). approve paar will be sent to bank for onward delivery to importer so that duty payment can be processed.
Post shipment; this starts when customs licensed agent receives documents from importer, proceed to calculate duty, then to (DtI café) direct trade input or Ncs site with new single windows upgrade to punch. after that is done duty payment is made, SON or NAFDAC payment is also made, necessary regulatory bodies requirement must have been fulfilled like Nafdac first stamp if it’s a drug, chemical, and food product.in addition terminal charges must have been paid in order for the containerized shipment to be dropped for examination, usually two date will be given for example 8 day of March or 9th day. Once the aforementioned is done clearing agent can approach customs for examination by submitting documents like the bill of lading, form m, paar, SGD, parking list, invoice, duty assessment, duty payment, etc. during this process agent should be able to ascertain if the customs examination will be scanning or physical examination. Furthermore, on the day of the examination customs and other regular agencies will be available to also partake. These agencies are; Police, Anti Bomb, NDLEA, DSS, NAFDAC/SON, QUARANTINE 
After the customs examination , report will be written by the examination officer and it will be sent to the senior  release officer who releases the shipment if all payments is in accordance with the law and there is no alert or query ,inspection act will be given to show that shipments can be released ,inspection act will be added to all the clearing document in order to conclude the gate out process .at this point shipping charges must have been paid and good must have been released by the shipping company
